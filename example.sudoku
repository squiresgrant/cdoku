; you can comment like this!
; anything after the initial 9x9 will be ignored
; spacing/linebreaks/non-integers are valid to put between numbers
;
; more indepth, for any line, the first 9 valid integers will be taken
; ie, a line of 000,9e3p0 0(00) will give the program an
; array equal to - {0,0,0, 9,3,0, 0,0,0}
